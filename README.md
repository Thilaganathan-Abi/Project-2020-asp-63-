# Project(2020-asp-63)
As deforestation and environmental degradation 
continue to escalate, there is an urgent need for community engagement in tree planting efforts. This project aims to create a digital platform that connects volunteers with local tree planting initiatives. By facilitating communication, we tackle the challenge of mobilizing community members to participate in reforestation activities.
